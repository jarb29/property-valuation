# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Property Valuation ML System documentation to GitHub Pages.

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

First, you need to push your code to a GitHub repository:

```bash
# If you haven't initialized a git repository yet
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with GitHub Pages documentation"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/property-valuation.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

After pushing your code to GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
2. Click on "Settings" (tab in the top navigation)
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Select the `/docs` folder as the source
6. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

GitHub will now build and deploy your site. This usually takes a minute or two. Once deployed, you'll see a message saying:

"Your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/property-valuation/"

### Step 4: Verify Your Deployment

Visit the URL provided to verify that your GitHub Pages site is working correctly. You should see the index.html page we created with links to all the documentation.

## Updating Your GitHub Pages Site

Whenever you want to update your GitHub Pages site:

1. Make your changes to the files in the `docs` directory
2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update documentation"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. GitHub will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Publishing

If your site isn't publishing:

1. Check that you've selected the correct branch and `/docs` folder in the GitHub Pages settings
2. Verify that your repository is public (or you have GitHub Pages enabled for private repositories)
3. Look for any build errors in the GitHub Pages section of your repository settings

### Custom Domain

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. In your repository settings, under GitHub Pages, enter your custom domain
2. Create a CNAME file in your `docs` directory with your domain name
3. Configure your DNS provider to point to GitHub Pages

## Conclusion

That's it! GitHub Pages deployment is a simple process that requires:

1. Pushing your code to GitHub
2. Configuring the GitHub Pages settings to use the `/docs` folder
3. Waiting for GitHub to build and deploy your site

No additional build steps or external services are required. GitHub automatically handles the building and serving of your documentation site.
